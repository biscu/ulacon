        CLI - Command Line Interface Simulation<br />
        A fun experiment for displaying simple info in a geeky manner.<br />
        Type 'help' + <kbd>Enter</kbd> -- for available commands.<br />

      <section class="hidden" id="about">
        <h2><span>&raquo;About</span></h2>
        <p>
          This is an experiment built by
          <a href="http://syndicatefx.com" target="_blank">Paulo Nunes</a> for
          showcasing a user profile or cv in an unusual but original way by
          simulating a command line interface. It's nothing more than the usual
          hidden elements triggered by some jQuery to show/hide each section of
          content, based on input values.<br />
          It makes use of
          <a
            href="https://github.com/gr8pathik/jquery-texttyper"
            target="_blank"
            >jQuery-texttyper</a
          >
          for the fancy letter animations.

      <section class="hidden" id="usage">
        <h2><span>&raquo;Usage</span></h2>
        <p>
          Using it is pretty straight forward. Create several(as much as you
          need) divs or &laquo;section&raquo; elements each with it's unique id
          to hold your content. Make sure to have an error section (id="error")
          with some information to warn the user when he/she mistypes a command
          or if there is no section with that name, think of it as a 404
          page.<br />
          A section with id="help" is also required so you can list all the
          available sections and let your users know what words to write to
          access that particular content.<br />
          The input field must be a standalone element and must not be placed
          inside any of the content divs or sections, and make sure you give it
          a classname "command", if you want to name it anything else you need
          to edit the app.js and change all instances of .command in the script
          to match your chosen classname.<br />
          In short, just view the source code of this demo, copy/modify it to
          your liking making sure you include the error and help sections.
